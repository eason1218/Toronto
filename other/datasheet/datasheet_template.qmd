abstract: "The 'Toronto_Shelter' dataset tracks shelter usage in Toronto, including occupancy rates, available beds, and shelter types, updated daily by the city's Housing and Homelessness Services department. It's self-contained, lacks sensitive information, and supports policy-making and resource allocation for homelessness services. Available through an API on the City of Toronto’s official site, the dataset can be used to analyze trends and predict shelter demand but should not be used for individual-level analysis. Missing values marked as “NA” may require consideration during analysis."

Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The census aims to monitor the capacity, utilization, and turnover in Toronto’s shelter system to understand the changing population of people experiencing homelessness and to inform policy decisions.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The data is collected and managed by the City of Toronto, specifically by the Housing and Homelessness Services department.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The initiative is typically funded through the city’s budget allocations and relevant housing policy funds.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The dataset includes information on Toronto shelter system usage, such as daily occupancy rates, shelter types (e.g., for families, men, women), the number of residents, and available beds.

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- Dataset is updated daily at 4 a.m., with new additions each day.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- No, the dataset is not a sample; it is the complete data directly uploaded from the shelters.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance now includes:
Date: A timestamp for when the data was recorded.
Occupancy Values: Two different columns for occupancy rates; some cells are missing values (NA).
Location Information: Specific details about the shelter's name and type.
Actual Beds/Occupancy: Counts for the actual number of beds available or occupied.
Sector: Categories such as "Youth," "Mixed Adult," "Men," or "Women" indicating the type of population served by the shelter.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No explicit target or label is identified, but columns such as "Actual Beds" and "Occupancy" could be considered potential targets for analysis.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Yes, some cells contain "NA," indicating missing values in columns like occupancy rates or bed counts. The extent and pattern of missingness need to be evaluated further.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships between instances are not explicitly marked. However, they can be inferred based on shared fields such as the location or sector.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- The dataset structure is not inherently split into different subsets (e.g., for training and testing). The data could be split based on shelter types, occupancy rates, or other factors for specific analyses.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There is missing data in some columns, as shown by the "NA" values. This could be considered a source of noise or incompleteness. It's important to inspect the data further to check for other inconsistencies or redundancies.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained and does not link to or rely on any external resources.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain any confidential information.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain any content that might be offensive or cause anxiety.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- No, the dataset does not identify any specific sub-populations.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain information that could be used to directly or indirectly identify individuals.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain any sensitive information.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)?
